Meet-Less is an intelligent meeting analysis tool that helps organizations reclaim productive time by identifying which meetings should be kept, optimized, or replaced with asynchronous communication.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Smart Meeting Classification** - Automatically identifies high-value vs. low-value meetings using our proprietary algorithm
- **Participation Analysis** - Detects meetings with too many silent participants and suggests attendance optimization
- **Frequency Optimization** - Identifies recurring meetings that could be held less frequently
- **Time Savings Calculator** - Quantifies potential hours saved through meeting optimization
- **Interactive Dashboard** - Visualizes meeting effectiveness with intuitive charts and graphs

## 💡 Why Meet-Less?

Organizations waste countless hours in unproductive meetings. Our analysis reveals:

- Only 28% of meetings result in actual decisions
- 65% of meetings could be handled asynchronously
- Meetings with <30% speaker participation waste most attendees' time
- Short meetings with high engagement are valuable even without formal decisions

Meet-Less transforms these insights into actionable recommendations, helping your team focus on what matters.
